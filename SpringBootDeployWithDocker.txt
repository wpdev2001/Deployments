# Steps for the deployment
1. Create the project
2. Pagkage it to jar or war file
   Steps for the packaging jar file
   a. Use the Maven tab (on right side of IntelliJ)
   b. go to "Execute maven goal" tab
   c. run "mvn clean install"
   Check for the target folder for the JAR file, the file has been created there
3. Create a docker file
   From openjdk:21
   WORKDIR /urs/src/myapp
   COPY . /urs/src/myapp/
   CMD [ "java", "-jar", "TestApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" ]
   EXPOSE 9090
4. Build the docker file using: 
      docker build -t bootimage .
5. Run the docker image using command(check for the image first and also the port which you've used, in this case it is 9090)
      docker run --name bootProject -it -p 9090:9090 -d bootimage
6. To stop it you could use
      docker stop bootProject
7. To check for the logs you could run
      docker logs
